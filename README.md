# ENG TRACKER APP FE (C.R.A.C.K - REVOU SHANGHAI)

This is a Front-end app for "Engineer Tracker Web App" that hopefully will be used (in a corporate situation) to track Engineer's daily timesheet and weekly report. Although still lacks a lot of feature, this will serve as a point to what I can understand and achieve up to this day.

From almost a 0-knowledge person when it come to HTTP/CSS/JS/TS, to now building the whole Web App using a pretty sophisticated framework.
I appreciate myself for the effort (~14 days of it), and of course all parties that have made me come this far.

This will not be my last HURRAH.

Ps. Won't be fancy readme, I'm running out of time.
